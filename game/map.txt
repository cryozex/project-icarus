# tree map of routes

special routes

# Kaori route
# Sakura route
# secret route (WIP)

certian level of pts required to achieve any
route and a certian pts to ged a good end

if neither gets sufficient pts then 

2-routes possible friend route good/bad

note: neither of these routes represent 
the true ending of this game

threshold set at 20-25 for routes inclusively >=30 req
to get a good ending 25-29 result in a bad ending
<20 is friend route <10 is bad end note: special neg pts
route achieved if <0 that is a non-cannon route
that differes greatly to the story and is nonsense
but made for the pure enjoyment of the player

Note: Sakura, Tomori and Kaori routes are special routes

Sakura route pertrays to the story as well as Kaori
Tomori route is slightly harder to achieve than the other routes
as it requires a perfect 30 pt score to achieve
Also Sakura route is only available after finishing the game
with any good ending.
